# UStacker

UStacker is a block stacking game heavily inspired by Tetris, Tetr.io, Jstris and in some parts by osu!. 
This game is developed with player customization in mind right from the start. You can find documentation on
customizing your game experience [here](https://github.com/MrakDun-desu/UStackerDocs).

This is an old version that is no longer maintained. The future of the game is developed [here](https://github.com/MrakDun-desu/UStacker).
